##For this project, I used SQL to query the World Health database to get information about general statistics around disease and demographic

--What are the top 5 Diseases with the Highest Average Mortality Rate (by Disease Category). 
--This query helps identify which diseases, grouped by category, tend to have the highest average death rates, revealing high-priority health risks globally.
SELECT 
    "Disease Category",
    "Disease Name",
    ROUND(AVG("Mortality Rate (%)"), 2) AS avg_mortality
FROM csv
GROUP BY "Disease Category", "Disease Name"
ORDER BY avg_mortality DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Compare Recovery Rates Based on Availability of Vaccines/Treatment. 
--This query compares the impact of having treatment available on recovery rates.
SELECT 
    "Availability of Vaccines/Treatment",
    ROUND(AVG("Recovery Rate (%)"), 2) AS avg_recovery
FROM csv
GROUP BY "Availability of Vaccines/Treatment";

--Countries with the Greatest Improvement in Health Outcomes Over 5 Years.
--This query reveals which countries have shown the greatest improvement in health outcomes, based on a custom metric already in the dataset.
SELECT 
    Country,
    ROUND(AVG("Improvement in 5 Years (%)"), 2) AS avg_improvement
FROM csv
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY avg_improvement DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Correlation Between Income, Education, and Recovery Rate.
--This gives insight into whether countries with higher income and education also see better recovery rates — a potential indication of access to healthcare and health literacy
SELECT 
    Country,
    "Per Capita Income (USD)",
    "Education Index",
    ROUND(AVG("Recovery Rate (%)"), 2) AS avg_recovery
FROM csv
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY avg_recovery DESC;

--Identify Diseases With Above-Average Mortality but Below-Average Recovery Rates.
--This query helps you pinpoint diseases that are particularly dangerous — those with mortality rates higher than average but recovery rates lower than average.
