##For this project, I used SQL to query the Global Remote Work Wellbeing database to get a mix of behavioral, health, and work performance metrics per employee.

--Is there a link between overwork and low work-life balance?
--Helps explore whether longer working hours are associated with lower work-life balance satisfaction.
WITH work_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        ROUND(AVG("Daily_Working_Hours"), 2) AS avg_hours,
        ROUND(AVG("Work_Life_Balance_Satisfaction"), 2) AS avg_wlb
    FROM GRWW
)
SELECT 
    avg_hours,
    avg_wlb,
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_hours > 9 THEN 'Overworking'
        ELSE 'Balanced Hours'
    END AS work_pattern
FROM work_stats;

--Who are the top 5 most stressed employees with the lowest sleep duration?
--Identifies at-risk employees who are sleeping poorly and showing high stress levels. Useful for mental health initiatives or targeted support.
SELECT 
    Employee_ID,
    Stress_Level,
    Sleep_Duration
FROM GRWW
ORDER BY "Stress_Level" DESC, "Sleep_Duration" ASC
LIMIT 5;

--Do more meetings reduce productivity? Grouped by meeting count.
--Helps uncover if a high number of meetings correlates with lower productivity, which can help inform smarter meeting policies.
SELECT 
    Meetings_Attended,
    ROUND(AVG(Productivity_Score), 2) AS avg_productivity
FROM GRWW
GROUP BY Meetings_Attended
ORDER BY Meetings_Attended;

--What is the average stress level by activity tier (low, medium, high)
--Examines how physical activity relates to stress and sleep, encouraging healthy lifestyle initiatives for remote employees.
WITH activity_levels AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN Physical_Activity_Steps >= 10000 THEN 'High Activity'
            WHEN Physical_Activity_Steps BETWEEN 5000 AND 9999 THEN 'Moderate Activity'
            ELSE 'Low Activity'
        END AS activity_group
