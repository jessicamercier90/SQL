##For this project, I used SQL to query the Health Care database to get information about patient visits and costs.
# Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset

--What is the average billing amount per insurance provider, and which one is most expensive on average?
--To identify which insurance providers are associated with higher average costs.
SELECT 
    "Insurance Provider", 
    ROUND(AVG("Billing Amount"), 2) AS avg_billing
FROM HealthCare
GROUP BY "Insurance Provider"
ORDER BY avg_billing DESC;

--Which hospitals admitted the highest number of emergency patients?
--This pinpoints which hospitals deal with the most emergency cases, which could relate to capacity, specialization, or regional need.
SELECT 
    Hospital, 
    COUNT(*) AS emergency_admissions
FROM HealthCare
WHERE "Admission Type" = 'Emergency'
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY emergency_admissions DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Which medical conditions are most commonly associated with abnormal or inconclusive test results?
--Helps identify high-risk conditions that more often lead to non-normal test results.
SELECT 
    "Medical Condition", 
    COUNT(*) AS flagged_cases
FROM HealthCare
WHERE "Test Results" IN ('Abnormal', 'Inconclusive')
GROUP BY "Medical Condition"
ORDER BY flagged_cases DESC;

--What's the average length of hospital stay by admission type?
--Analyzes how long patients stay based on how they were admitted (Emergency vs. Elective vs. Urgent).
SELECT 
    "Admission Type",
    ROUND(AVG(JULIANDAY("Discharge Date") - JULIANDAY("Date of Admission")), 1) AS avg_stay_days
FROM HealthCare
GROUP BY "Admission Type"
ORDER BY avg_stay_days DESC;
